## Methods
```js
steaminventory.getinventory(appid, steamid, contextid);
```
- appid: This is the [appid](https://steamdb.info/apps/) for the game that you want to load the inventory items for.
- steamid: This is the [steam64](https://steamid.io/lookup/) id of the user that you want to load.
- contextid: Context id is an id set by the game. For valve games it's usually 2.
#### Data resolve
- data.raw: Raw information recieved from the servers.
- data.items: All the information about the items. (Like icon urls, descriptions, name colors ect)
- data.marketnames: All the market names of the items in the inventory returned as a javascript object.
- data.assets: All the information about the assets in the inventory
- data.assetids: Every assetid in the inventory
## Examples

### Get the item names
```js
const steaminventory = require('./index.js');
const steamid = '76561198089544929';
steaminventory.getinventory(730, steamid, '2').then(data => {
    console.log(data.marketnames);
}).catch(err => console.log(err));

```
**Output**
```js
[ 'Sealed Graffiti | NaCl (Shark White)',
  'Glove Case',
  'Gamma 2 Case',
  'Chroma 2 Case',
  'AND LOTS OF MORE INFORMATION OR NAMES :)']
```
Well, using that example may not be the best thing if you are trying to get something useful out of it.
We recommend this instead:

### Get raw
```js
const steaminventory = require('./index.js');
const steamid = '76561198089544929';
steaminventory.getinventory(730, steamid, '2').then(data => {
    console.log(data.raw);
}).catch(err => console.log(err));
//This one logs EVERY name of the items in the inventory.
```
**Output**
```js
{ appid: 730,
       classid: '1989274437',
       instanceid: '302028390',
       currency: 0,
       background_color: '',
       icon_url: 'IzMF03bi9WpSBq-S-ekoE33L-iLqGFHVaU25ZzQNQcXdB2ozio1RrlIWFK3Uf'
```
### Get assets
```js
const steaminventory = require('./index.js');
const steamid = '76561198089544929';
steaminventory.getinventory(730, steamid, '2').then(data => {
    console.log(data.assets);
}).catch(err => console.log(err));
//This one logs EVERY name of the items in the inventory.
```
**Output**
```js
{ appid: 730,
    contextid: '2',
    assetid: '13106527064',
    classid: '1989315922',
    instanceid: '302028390',
    amount: '1' },
  { appid: 730,
    contextid: '2',
```
